# [Brief]
## Notes

From this we can take away the following pieces of information:

-   There are three machines on the network
-   There is at least one public facing webserver
-   There is a self-hosted git server somewhere on the network
-   The git server is internal, so Thomas may have pushed sensitive information into it 
-   There is a PC running on the network that has antivirus installed, meaning we can hazard a guess that this is likely to be Windows
-   By the sounds of it this is likely to be the server variant of Windows, which might work in our favour
-   The (assumed) Windows PC cannot be accessed directly from the webserver
