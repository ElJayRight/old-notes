# [NET basics]
## Notes

CLR - Commonly Lacking Radiation

Normally built in C#
Can use powershell and C# to complie into the common intermediary language (CIL). NET directly interfaces with Win32 and API calls.
.Net has two different branches:
- .NET farmework (windows only)
- .NET Core (Cross-Compatible)
the .NET assemblies are the key component which can be compiled into .exes and .dlls which can be run by powershell.

.Net Language -> CIL/MSIL -> CLR -> machine code
